    description: 'The Luna Rossa Team writes a page in history by defeating 10 opponents, with a record of 38 wins over 49 races.
The last is U.S.’s Paul Cayard with his green and grey boat; it takes all the rule’s 9 races to win the Louis Vuitton Cup series and gain the right to challenge Team New Zealand.
It is the first time that an Italian skipper races the America’s Cup final Match, and the first time there is no American yacht in the Cups’ finals.'

The two partners in Luna Rossa Challenge 2007 are the Prada Group and the Telecom Italia Group.
In February 2004, the Luna Rossa Team is the first to set up its base in Valencia, where it starts training in May with ITA 74 and ITA 80.
While the original historic core of the Team remains, new top level talents are included in all departments. Innovative technology is also introduced.
The Team Luna Rossa Challenge 2007 (sailing team, design team, shore team, weather team, performance team, boat builders, sail loft, logistics, administration and management) now includes about 150 people from 18 different countries.'

                of 16”. On the downwind leg Luna Rossa stretches forward with a 60
                meter lead and decides to drop the spinnaker at the left mark, anticipating
                Gavin Brady (NZL) and his crew by 17”.</p><p>The second upwind leg
                initially shows an advantage for Luna Rossa with a 120 meter lead.
                Soon after, however, Mascalzone closes the gap and rounds the mark
                only 8” behind. </p></li><li><p>The last leg of the course is decisive for the outcome
                of the race. The boats divide once again and Mascalzone choses to
                sail downwind on the left side, forcing Luna Rossa to stay on the
                right. At this point Mascalzone, now in front, gybes and crosses,
                reaching the finish line with a 5” lead.</p>

                hoist. The downwind leg is very close and Azzurra turns at the left
                mark with only 2” of advantage and stays on the left side for the
                next upwind leg; Luna Rossa goes to the right but is unable to find
                an equal wind pressure. In the second upwind leg Azzurra gains a further
                advantage and rounds the mark 30” in front of Luna Rossa. The final
                downwind does not allow any possibility to overtake Azzurra, and the
                race closes with a 29”delay of Luna Rossa behind Azzurra.</p></li><li><p>Max
                Sirena, runners and manager of the Luna Rossa sailing program, said:</p><p>“Obviously
                we are not happy with this result. The loss of two races wherewe started
                out in front is disappointing. We will analyze our mistakes andcorrect
                them. Today we lost against Azzurra, tomorrow we will be back onthe
                water to win and move forward. This crew has not trained together
                for along time and all of the teams here are at a very high level.
                We still haveseven races to go and the will to do better.”</p>

        details: <p>Dean Barker (NZL) wins the start at the helm of the New Zealand
                team, with a fast start on the pin side; Luna Rossa choses to start
                near the Committee boat on the right and upwind with respect to Team
                New Zealand. Although the kiwi boat stays in front during the upwind
                leg, when rounding the mark Luna Rossa stretches forward and rounds
                the mark in front.</p><p>On the downwind leg the wind shifts allow
                Team New Zealand to move in front again but Luna Rossa, with a good
                upwind tactic, is able to move forward and leave Team New Zealand
                behind. On the finish line the delta is of 13” for Luna Rossa, who
                gains its first point in Round Robin 1.</p>

        details: <p>Today’s race was won at the start. Luna Rossa starts windward
                on its opponent and stretches forward on the first upwind leg. The
                distance on the American boat increases as Luna Rossa rounds the first

                length and turns the mark 34″ behind Luna Rossa who maintains the
                control all the way to the finish line, with a 22″ lead on the American
                boat. With this win Luna Rossa gains its second point in the round

                is forced to tack to the right of the course and continues the windward
                leg on port tack. A 15° wind shift to the left further increases the
                advantage of Team Origin to 5 boat lengths at the windward mark, an
                advantage that the British will keep until the end of the race, notwithstanding

                a problem when lowering the spinnaker around the mark. The distance

        date: 05/06/10
        details: <p>Luna Rossa, qualified for quarter finals at the end of the first
                Round Robin, closed the first series of races in front of Bmw Oracle
                Racing and Team Aleph, both of which were excluded from the ranking.
                Unfortunately, due to wind conditions that did not favour the regattas,
                the race between the first and 8th ranking team did not take place
                and Luna Rossa, who should have raced against All4One, did not have
                the chance to compete for a place in the semi-finals.</p><p>The race
                format for the selection, modified during the course of the event,
                was such that Team New Zealand, Artemis, All4One and Synergy entered
                semi-finals. Luna Rossa therefore reached the end of the event with
                three wins and an 8th place in the Louis Vuitton Trophy de La Maddalena.</p><p>The
                next event for Luna Rossa will be the Marseilles Trophy, from June
                15 to 20 giugno, in the Audi Med Cup TP 52′ circuit.</p>

        popup_description: ! '<p>Patrizio Bertelli, Team Principal of Luna Rossa Challenge
                2013, was born in Arezzo, Italy, in 1946, to a family of lawyers.
                He studies Engineering in Bologna, and in 1968 he establishes a small
                company producing belts and bags in Arezzo, which later serves as
                a basis for the development of his future business.</p><p></p><p>In
                1977, he meets Miuccia Prada, whom he will later marry, and they sign
                an agreement for the production and marketing of leather goods under
                the “Prada” brand; this marks the beginning of an association whose
                success is expressed by the history of the PRADA Group.</p><p></p><p>Ever
                since the early years, Patrizio Bertelli''s ability to foresee and
                anticipate social, lifestyle and market changes, and to seize consumers''
                aspirations, prompts him to review the brand''s image on a totally
                new basis, without altering its DNA but rather by combining the brand''s
                know-how, history and century-old heritage with an extremely innovative
                approach, that is implemented in all process phases. The working method
                is also revisited, by means of implementing tight control over the
                whole value chain, a business model later adopted throughout the industry.</p><p></p><p>Uncompromising
                quality - in all process steps - and innovation, in keeping with the
                brand''s century-old heritage and with the artisan soul of its production,
                are the core values that always inspired Patrizio Bertelli and Miuccia
                Prada in their development.</p><p></p><p>In the 1980s and 1990s, Prada
                experiences a strong growth thanks to the introduction of new product
                categories - Prada Women''s ready-to-wear in 1988 and Prada Men in
                1993 - and the establishment of a new brand, Miu Miu, in 1993. In
                early 1997 the natural extension of the Prada collection, i.e. leisure
                time and sport products, is added, characterised by the now unmistakable
                "red stripe".</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Prada also embarks in
                an international expansion plan by opening directly operated stores
                in the most exclusive locations of the main world cities and of prestigious
                tourist resorts, until, as of January 31st, 2012, the Group reaches
                a total of 388 directly operated stores in 70 different countries
                worldwide.</p><p></p><p>Prada also grows by acquiring the luxury footwear
                brands Church’s and Car Shoe, and by adding new product categories:
                eyewear, fragrances and mobile phones - in 2007, in collaboration
                with LG Electronics, the brand launches the first touch-screen mobile
                phone ever.</p><p></p><p>In October 2000 he receives a Honoris Causa
                degree in Business Administration from the Università degli Studi
                di Firenze and in 2006, the US magazine Time includes Patrizio Bertelli
                and Miuccia Prada among the 100 most influential couples in the world.</p><p></p><p>Since
                June 24th, 2011, 20% of Prada SpA''s shares are listed on the Hong
                Kong Stock Exchange, with an initial valuation of the company equal
                to 9.3 billion Euros.</p><p></p><p>Patrizio Bertelli combines his
                business activity with cultural interests that he shares with his
                wife. Those interests prompted the establishment of the “Fondazione
                Prada”, that organises and supports contemporary art exhibitions and
                other cultural endeavours, mainly in the fields of cinema, philosophy
                and architecture, rewarded by unanimous international acclaim.</p><p></p><p>A
                passionate sailor, in 1997 he launches his first challenge to the
                America’s Cup (2000 edition) and wins the Louis Vuitton Cup. He challenges
                again for the 2003 and 2007 editions, reaching the Louis Vuitton Cup
                final in the latter. He is one of the European personalities who left
                a very deep mark in the history of the America’s Cup.</p><p></p><p>An
                accomplished yachtsman, Patrizio Bertelli loves sailing and not just
                racing; he spends his summer holidays cruising on the “Ulisse”, the
                family yacht, and he is also passionate about vintage boats.</p>'

        details: <p>Nonostante un nono ed un undicesimo posto nelle prime due regate
                odierne, il team Luna Rossa è riuscito, nella terza prova, a riscattarsi
                conquistando il primo successo di stagione.</p><p>La giornata è stata
                caratterizzata da vento di Levante sui 10/15 nodi, mare formato con

                merito anche del pompaggio libero.</p><p>La vittoria della terza prova,
                la prima di stagione, è stata conquistata grazie ad una regata condotta
                senza alcun errore da parte dell’equipaggio. Luna Rossa al momento
                risulta settima dopo le prime tre prove con 21 punti totali.</p><p>Domani
                sono in programma altre tre regate, la tappa di Barcellona terminerà

                today contributed to the current result that shows Luna Rossa at the

                skipper, commented:</p><p>“We were satisfied with the first race,
                but are obviously disappointed at the outcome the last two regattas.</p><p>Unfortunately,
                with two incorrect starts, we were unable to bring the boat back into
                the race and to move up towards the head of the fleet.</p></li><li><p>Our goal
                was to gain enought points so as to rank in first half of the group.</p><p>Today’s
                conditions however did not allow us to achieve this result, and we
                know that a good start would have made a big difference. We still
                have some time to improve our results and to prove that we can do
                better.”</p>

                Trophy event. The points gained were not valid for ranking purposes
                but the testing was useful to obtain comparative feedback.</p><p>The
                teams carried out  two trial starts in which Luna Rossa performed
                well against the rest of the fleet. The third start was followed by
                the practice race, and won by Swedish Team Artemis. Luna Rossa came

                the fact that we improved</p></li><li><p>a few things from yesterday. The turning
                point was the choice of the right side. The course has a very strong
                current, an aspect that significally influenced our tactic choices.
                For us a forced side is always difficult; we don’t have a faster boat,
                so we try to sail more freely and to make our gains through tactic
                choices.”</p>

                at 2.30 pm with Sirocco winds blowing around 10 knots.</p><p>On the

                Team New Zealand dominated the fleet, and Luna Rossa rounded the mark
                in eighth position. On the downwind leg the Italian team chose the
                right side of the course, postponing their jibe of a few lengths compared
                to its opponent, and thus gaining, when crossing at the mark, a good
                lead and moving up to a second place. This position was maintained
                throughout the rest of the race and up to the finish line. The race
                was won by the Argentinian team Matador.</p></li><li><p>In the second race
                Luna Rossa crossed the line in seventh position, and closed the day
                with a total of 9 points, resulting in a fourth place in the provisional
                overall ranking.</p><p>Max Sirena (ITA), pitman Luna Rossa:</p><p>“In
                the first race the tactical choice on the upwind leg allowed us to
                move up to second place and to maintain this advantage on the rest
                of the fleet by sailing independently from the rest of the fleet.During
                the second race instead we were controlled more closely by the other
                boats, and it wasn’t easy to move away from them while also maintaining
                a good position.”</p>

        date: 29/08/10
        details: <p>A bout of bad luck today contributed to part of the day’s results.
                Team Luna Rossa earned in the two races respectively nine and fifteen
                points. A number of problems on board were triggered by unpredictable
                events. In the first race bowman Giulio Giovanella was injured and
                required a substitution. In the coastal race a sunfish got wrapped
                around the rudder, event that, coupled with simultaneous break of
                the gennaker retriever and mainsail battens, contributed to a mix
                of misfortune that sometimes can happen in racing.</p><p>Both races
                today were won by EmiratesTeam New Zealand who, thanks to the day’s
                results, is first in the provisional ranking. Luna Rossa is now seventh.</p></li><li><p>Gabriele
                Benussi (ITA), Luna Rossa tactician:</p><p>“For sure today we got
                no help from luck. In the first race our bowman was injured and had
                to be taken to the hospital. Then, in the last downind leg of the
                coastal race, when we were third and had a comfortable lead on the
                boats behind us, a large sunfish got wrapped around the rudder. The
                impact was so violent that for a moment we thought we had broken the
                rudder. At that point we were obliged to drop the gennaker and back
                so as to free the rudder, and obviously lost a lot of time there.
                To make things worse, when hoisting the gennaker, the retriever broke
                and the sail trailed in the water for a few moments.”</p>

                the first time that our team raced in this class, and our boat ended
                up not being very competitive compared to the others. The level of
                these races is very high, and every small detail makes a diffrence.
                We did our best, and the result was obviously very disappointing for
                us. However, we well know that sport is about winning and losing”.</p><p>Future
                plans for Luna Rossa will be decided during the coming winter months.</p>

        popup_description: ! '<p>Patrizio Bertelli, Team Principal of Luna Rossa Challenge
                2013, was born in Arezzo, Italy, in 1946, to a family of lawyers.
                He studies Engineering in Bologna, and in 1968 he establishes a small
                company producing belts and bags in Arezzo, which later serves as
                a basis for the development of his future business.</p><p></p><p>In
                1977, he meets Miuccia Prada, whom he will later marry, and they sign
                an agreement for the production and marketing of leather goods under
                the “Prada” brand; this marks the beginning of an association whose
                success is expressed by the history of the PRADA Group.</p><p></p><p>Ever
                since the early years, Patrizio Bertelli''s ability to foresee and
                anticipate social, lifestyle and market changes, and to seize consumers''
                aspirations, prompts him to review the brand''s image on a totally
                new basis, without altering its DNA but rather by combining the brand''s
                know-how, history and century-old heritage with an extremely innovative
                approach, that is implemented in all process phases. The working method
                is also revisited, by means of implementing tight control over the
                whole value chain, a business model later adopted throughout the industry.</p><p></p><p>Uncompromising
                quality - in all process steps - and innovation, in keeping with the
                brand''s century-old heritage and with the artisan soul of its production,
                are the core values that always inspired Patrizio Bertelli and Miuccia
                Prada in their development.</p><p></p><p>In the 1980s and 1990s, Prada
                experiences a strong growth thanks to the introduction of new product
                categories - Prada Women''s ready-to-wear in 1988 and Prada Men in
                1993 - and the establishment of a new brand, Miu Miu, in 1993. In
                early 1997 the natural extension of the Prada collection, i.e. leisure
                time and sport products, is added, characterised by the now unmistakable
                "red stripe".</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Prada also embarks in
                an international expansion plan by opening directly operated stores
                in the most exclusive locations of the main world cities and of prestigious
                tourist resorts, until, as of January 31st, 2012, the Group reaches
                a total of 388 directly operated stores in 70 different countries
                worldwide.</p><p></p><p>Prada also grows by acquiring the luxury footwear
                brands Church’s and Car Shoe, and by adding new product categories:
                eyewear, fragrances and mobile phones - in 2007, in collaboration
                with LG Electronics, the brand launches the first touch-screen mobile
                phone ever.</p><p></p><p>In October 2000 he receives a Honoris Causa
                degree in Business Administration from the Università degli Studi
                di Firenze and in 2006, the US magazine Time includes Patrizio Bertelli
                and Miuccia Prada among the 100 most influential couples in the world.</p><p></p><p>Since
                June 24th, 2011, 20% of Prada SpA''s shares are listed on the Hong
                Kong Stock Exchange, with an initial valuation of the company equal
                to 9.3 billion Euros.</p><p></p><p>Patrizio Bertelli combines his
                business activity with cultural interests that he shares with his
                wife. Those interests prompted the establishment of the “Fondazione
                Prada”, that organises and supports contemporary art exhibitions and
                other cultural endeavours, mainly in the fields of cinema, philosophy
                and architecture, rewarded by unanimous international acclaim.</p><p></p><p>A
                passionate sailor, in 1997 he launches his first challenge to the
                America’s Cup (2000 edition) and wins the Louis Vuitton Cup. He challenges
                again for the 2003 and 2007 editions, reaching the Louis Vuitton Cup
                final in the latter. He is one of the European personalities who left
                a very deep mark in the history of the America’s Cup.</p><p></p><p>An
                accomplished yachtsman, Patrizio Bertelli loves sailing and not just
                racing; he spends his summer holidays cruising on the “Ulisse”, the
                family yacht, and he is also passionate about vintage boats.</p>'

                is a big result for us because we are a new team in this circuit.

                Our position in the ranking kept on changing after each race. In the
                first two races we weren’t very lucky: conditions were difficult,
                with no wind and lots of wave. In the races that followed however
                we nailed a series of perfect starts. The guys made no mistakes and
                the impeccable tactics contributed to the end result. I think it was
                a well-deserved win, fruit of a lot of hard work and lessons learned

                the weather in the Solent today turned out to be true to its fame.</p><p>The
                first day of races took place under grey skies and 12 knot winds,
                with strong tides and moderate currents. After the third race, that
                Luna Rossa won with a comfortable lead, the wind rose up to 20 knots,
                opposite to the direction of the tides, that were  about 3,5 knots,
                and that obliged the Jury to partially lower the mainsail  and, after
                that, to rule out the use of the gennaker. Finally, and unfortunately
                for us, racing was canceled. </p></li><li><p>I say unfortunately because Luna Rossa
                was doing really well and had come through a tricky racing situation

                The penalty assigned to Nice 4 U by the umpires took this damage into

                that were certainly not our  best, Luna Rossa today came back with
                a score  that allowed her to take home a well-deserved second place.
                We see this second place as a very worthy achievment that brings Luna
                Rossa to second in the overall ranking, right behind Team New Zealand.</p><p>The
                combination of some really good starts and well-managed races has
                finally brought the team to a level that we believe reflects our work.</p><p>Unfortunately
                we were involved in a collision provoked by Gitana, and although there
                was no major damage,  the umpire decision did not favour us and the
                resulting score didn't allow us to win the event. In any case the
                result of 15 days spent</p></li><li><p> in Cowes is a very positive one. The final
                outcome was altogether excellent, notwithstanding  factors such as
                the extreme weather, that obliged  the race committee to cancel a
                day of racing for the first time in the history of this event, and
                the strong currents and shallow waters in the racecourse area.</p><p>In
                fact, not only are we pleased to have placed second, but to be taking
                home a 'sound' boat, whereas some other teams' boats were damaged
                due to collisions, etc.</p><p>We really look forward to racing in

        popup_description: ! '<p>Patrizio Bertelli, Team Principal of Luna Rossa Challenge
                2013, was born in Arezzo, Italy, in 1946, to a family of lawyers.
                He studies Engineering in Bologna, and in 1968 he establishes a small
                company producing belts and bags in Arezzo, which later serves as
                a basis for the development of his future business.</p><p></p><p>In
                1977, he meets Miuccia Prada, whom he will later marry, and they sign
                an agreement for the production and marketing of leather goods under
                the “Prada” brand; this marks the beginning of an association whose
                success is expressed by the history of the PRADA Group.</p><p></p><p>Ever
                since the early years, Patrizio Bertelli''s ability to foresee and
                anticipate social, lifestyle and market changes, and to seize consumers''
                aspirations, prompts him to review the brand''s image on a totally
                new basis, without altering its DNA but rather by combining the brand''s
                know-how, history and century-old heritage with an extremely innovative
                approach, that is implemented in all process phases. The working method
                is also revisited, by means of implementing tight control over the
                whole value chain, a business model later adopted throughout the industry.</p><p></p><p>Uncompromising
                quality - in all process steps - and innovation, in keeping with the
                brand''s century-old heritage and with the artisan soul of its production,
                are the core values that always inspired Patrizio Bertelli and Miuccia
                Prada in their development.</p><p></p><p>In the 1980s and 1990s, Prada
                experiences a strong growth thanks to the introduction of new product
                categories - Prada Women''s ready-to-wear in 1988 and Prada Men in
                1993 - and the establishment of a new brand, Miu Miu, in 1993. In
                early 1997 the natural extension of the Prada collection, i.e. leisure
                time and sport products, is added, characterised by the now unmistakable
                "red stripe".</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Prada also embarks in
                an international expansion plan by opening directly operated stores
                in the most exclusive locations of the main world cities and of prestigious
                tourist resorts, until, as of January 31st, 2012, the Group reaches
                a total of 388 directly operated stores in 70 different countries
                worldwide.</p><p></p><p>Prada also grows by acquiring the luxury footwear
                brands Church’s and Car Shoe, and by adding new product categories:
                eyewear, fragrances and mobile phones - in 2007, in collaboration
                with LG Electronics, the brand launches the first touch-screen mobile
                phone ever.</p><p></p><p>In October 2000 he receives a Honoris Causa
                degree in Business Administration from the Università degli Studi
                di Firenze and in 2006, the US magazine Time includes Patrizio Bertelli
                and Miuccia Prada among the 100 most influential couples in the world.</p><p></p><p>Since
                June 24th, 2011, 20% of Prada SpA''s shares are listed on the Hong
                Kong Stock Exchange, with an initial valuation of the company equal
                to 9.3 billion Euros.</p><p></p><p>Patrizio Bertelli combines his
                business activity with cultural interests that he shares with his
                wife. Those interests prompted the establishment of the “Fondazione
                Prada”, that organises and supports contemporary art exhibitions and
                other cultural endeavours, mainly in the fields of cinema, philosophy
                and architecture, rewarded by unanimous international acclaim.</p><p></p><p>A
                passionate sailor, in 1997 he launches his first challenge to the
                America’s Cup (2000 edition) and wins the Louis Vuitton Cup. He challenges
                again for the 2003 and 2007 editions, reaching the Louis Vuitton Cup
                final in the latter. He is one of the European personalities who left
                a very deep mark in the history of the America’s Cup.</p><p></p><p>An
                accomplished yachtsman, Patrizio Bertelli loves sailing and not just
                racing; he spends his summer holidays cruising on the “Ulisse”, the
                family yacht, and he is also passionate about vintage boats.</p>'
