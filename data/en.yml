    description: 'The Luna Rossa Team writes a page in history by defeating 10 opponents, with a record of 38 wins over 49 races.
The last is U.S.’s Paul Cayard with his green and grey boat; it takes all the rule’s 9 races to win the Louis Vuitton Cup series and gain the right to challenge Team New Zealand.
It is the first time that an Italian skipper races the America’s Cup final Match, and the first time there is no American yacht in the Cups’ finals.'

The two partners in Luna Rossa Challenge 2007 are the Prada Group and the Telecom Italia Group.
In February 2004, the Luna Rossa Team is the first to set up its base in Valencia, where it starts training in May with ITA 74 and ITA 80.
While the original historic core of the Team remains, new top level talents are included in all departments. Innovative technology is also introduced.
The Team Luna Rossa Challenge 2007 (sailing team, design team, shore team, weather team, performance team, boat builders, sail loft, logistics, administration and management) now includes about 150 people from 18 different countries.'

Among these are navigator Matteo Plazzi, pitman Simone de Mari and the responsible for the rigging development Max Sirena.'

        popup_description: ! '<p>Patrizio Bertelli, Team Principal of Luna Rossa Challenge
                2013, was born in Arezzo, Italy, in 1946, to a family of lawyers.
                He studies Engineering in Bologna, and in 1968 he establishes a small
                company producing belts and bags in Arezzo, which later serves as
                a basis for the development of his future business.</p><p></p><p>In
                1977, he meets Miuccia Prada, whom he will later marry, and they sign
                an agreement for the production and marketing of leather goods under
                the “Prada” brand; this marks the beginning of an association whose
                success is expressed by the history of the PRADA Group.</p><p></p><p>Ever
                since the early years, Patrizio Bertelli''s ability to foresee and
                anticipate social, lifestyle and market changes, and to seize consumers''
                aspirations, prompts him to review the brand''s image on a totally
                new basis, without altering its DNA but rather by combining the brand''s
                know-how, history and century-old heritage with an extremely innovative
                approach, that is implemented in all process phases. The working method
                is also revisited, by means of implementing tight control over the
                whole value chain, a business model later adopted throughout the industry.</p><p></p><p>Uncompromising
                quality - in all process steps - and innovation, in keeping with the
                brand''s century-old heritage and with the artisan soul of its production,
                are the core values that always inspired Patrizio Bertelli and Miuccia
                Prada in their development.</p><p></p><p>In the 1980s and 1990s, Prada
                experiences a strong growth thanks to the introduction of new product
                categories - Prada Women''s ready-to-wear in 1988 and Prada Men in
                1993 - and the establishment of a new brand, Miu Miu, in 1993. In
                early 1997 the natural extension of the Prada collection, i.e. leisure
                time and sport products, is added, characterised by the now unmistakable
                "red stripe".</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Prada also embarks in
                an international expansion plan by opening directly operated stores
                in the most exclusive locations of the main world cities and of prestigious
                tourist resorts, until, as of January 31st, 2012, the Group reaches
                a total of 388 directly operated stores in 70 different countries
                worldwide.</p><p></p><p>Prada also grows by acquiring the luxury footwear
                brands Church’s and Car Shoe, and by adding new product categories:
                eyewear, fragrances and mobile phones - in 2007, in collaboration
                with LG Electronics, the brand launches the first touch-screen mobile
                phone ever.</p><p></p><p>In October 2000 he receives a Honoris Causa
                degree in Business Administration from the Università degli Studi
                di Firenze and in 2006, the US magazine Time includes Patrizio Bertelli
                and Miuccia Prada among the 100 most influential couples in the world.</p><p></p><p>Since
                June 24th, 2011, 20% of Prada SpA''s shares are listed on the Hong
                Kong Stock Exchange, with an initial valuation of the company equal
                to 9.3 billion Euros.</p><p></p><p>Patrizio Bertelli combines his
                business activity with cultural interests that he shares with his
                wife. Those interests prompted the establishment of the “Fondazione
                Prada”, that organises and supports contemporary art exhibitions and
                other cultural endeavours, mainly in the fields of cinema, philosophy
                and architecture, rewarded by unanimous international acclaim.</p><p></p><p>A
                passionate sailor, in 1997 he launches his first challenge to the
                America’s Cup (2000 edition) and wins the Louis Vuitton Cup. He challenges
                again for the 2003 and 2007 editions, reaching the Louis Vuitton Cup
                final in the latter. He is one of the European personalities who left
                a very deep mark in the history of the America’s Cup.</p><p></p><p>An
                accomplished yachtsman, Patrizio Bertelli loves sailing and not just
                racing; he spends his summer holidays cruising on the “Ulisse”, the
                family yacht, and he is also passionate about vintage boats.</p>'
